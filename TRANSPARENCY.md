# 🔍 Transparency Statement

BehLand is committed to transparency, accountability, and open access to information.
This document explains how transparency is implemented across the project and how stakeholders can independently verify key aspects of the ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Transparency

The goal of transparency in BehLand is to:
- Enable independent review and due diligence (DYOR)
- Reduce information asymmetry between the team and the community
- Clearly communicate how funds, permissions, and responsibilities are managed
- Build long-term trust through verifiable data rather than claims

Transparency is treated as an ongoing process, not a one-time action.

## 📚 Open Documentation

All official BehLand documents are publicly available in this GitHub organization.
This includes:
- LitePaper and conceptual documentation
- Token-related information
- Security and audit status
- Wallet structure and fund management explanations
- Official links and communication channels

Each major documentation folder contains its own README to provide context and clarity.

## 🏦 Financial Transparency

BehLand maintains a structured wallet architecture:
- A **main treasury wallet** used for long-term reserves and presale funds
- An **operational wallet** used for day-to-day expenses

The treasury wallet is protected using **multi-signature authorization**, ensuring that no single individual can unilaterally move core funds.
All transactions are traceable on-chain via public explorers.

---

## 🔑 Governance & Access Control

- Critical actions are protected by role separation and approval mechanisms
- Owner-level permissions are limited and documented
- No single-signer control exists over treasury-level assets
- Changes to access structure are documented publicly when applicable

This approach minimizes centralization risk and single points of failure.
