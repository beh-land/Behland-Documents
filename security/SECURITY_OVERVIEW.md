# 🔐 Security & Transparency Overview

This document provides a clear overview of the security structure, wallet architecture, and transparency principles of the BehLand project.
Its purpose is to allow external reviewers to quickly understand how assets, permissions, and responsibilities are managed.

## 🏦 Wallet Structure

BehLand operates multiple wallets, each with a clearly defined role:

### Main Treasury Wallet
- Holds primary funds related to presales and long-term reserves
- Protected using **multi-signature authorization**
- Transactions require approval from multiple trusted signers
- No single individual has unilateral control over treasury funds

### Operational Wallet
- Used for day-to-day operational expenses
- Funded periodically from the treasury
- Subject to internal spending controls

## 🔑 Access Control & Permissions

BehLand follows a principle of **separated responsibilities**:

- **Owner-level actions** are restricted and limited
- **Administrative actions** are scoped and role-based
- Critical operations require multi-party approval
- There are no unrestricted single-signer permissions over core assets

This structure reduces single points of failure and operational risk.

## 💧 Liquidity & Fund Management

- Liquidity is managed under protocol-level controls
- There is no unrestricted liquidity withdrawal
- Fund movements are transparent and traceable on-chain
- Any changes to liquidity management will be publicly documented

BehLand prioritizes controlled fund usage over speculative liquidity mechanisms.

## 🔍 Transparency Commitment

- All official wallets are documented
- All token-related contracts are publicly verifiable
- Security and audit updates are published openly
- This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for security-related information
